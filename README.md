# DataMesser
This is a side project about generating the MongoDB Script to ingest a huge amount of raw data into MongoDB.
The raw data could have up to 700 columns and need to be in a specific hierarchy structure. In this case would be the MISMO structure.

The Database MISMO_Path contain all the information from the mapping file, which is the schema of this application.

The Database System used here is MongoDB, and the collection was named "FullSample_Test"

Code Generator is used for generating code.
