# DataMesser
This is a side project about generating the MongoDB Script to ingest a huge amount of raw data into MongoDB. 
The raw data could have up to 700 collumns and need to be in a specific hierarchy structure. In this case would be the MISMO structure.

Code Generator is used for generate code.
